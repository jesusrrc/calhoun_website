				<h1>CLASS POLICY:</h1>
				
					<h4><b>Student Expectations:</b></h4>
					
						<ul style="padding-left:20px">
							<li>Read all course materials, including the syllabus and description of the grading and testing systems 
							to be used in the course.</li>
							<li>Attend every class session and complete all assignments on time.</li>
							<li>Participate in all classroom learning activities.</li>
							<li>Interact respectfully with faculty, staff, and fellow students.</li>
							<li>Refrain from all academic misconduct</li>
							<li>Avoid situations that give the appearance of misconduct.</li>
							<li>Report any observed academic misconduct.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<h4><b>Attendance:</b></h4>
					
						<p>
							To succeed in the course, students must attend and participate in each class session. 
							If you miss a session, it is your responsibility to learn any material missed. Students 
							who are absent more than 5 times will receive an automatic zero for participation in the 
							course (5% of the final grade).  Excused absences are excluded from this policy; excused 
							absences must be arranged in advance and are at instructor discretion. Students must be 
							present for each scheduled test and exam. Students not present during these times without 
							making prior arrangements will receive a zero for that work.
						</p>
						
					<h4><b>CS Colloquium:</b></h4>
					
						<p>
							The Computer Science Department sponsors a Friday colloquium series. 
							The event is usually held in Room 100 of the Computer Science Building, 
							but that location is subject to change. During the semester you are encouraged 
							to attend these talks. You may obtain extra credit for the course by attending 
							up to three of these presentations. Record your summary of each talk on the appropriate 
							form and submit to Canvas.
						</p>
						
					<h4><b>Course Administration:</b></h4>
				
						<p>
							Supplementary information for this course is available on Canvas. The class notes, 
							PowerPoint slides, class announcements, the course syllabus, test dates, and other 
							information for the course would be posted on Canvas. Each homework assignment and project will be 
							made available through Canvas. You may find downloading the Canvas app to your smartphone as 
							extremely helpful also. 
						</p>
					
					<h4><b>Electronic Submission:</b></h4>
					
						<p>
							Students bear sole responsibility for ensuring that assignments 
							submitted electronically to an instructor are received in a timely 
							manner and in the electronic format(s) specified by the instructor.  
							Students are also strongly advised to retain a copy of the dated submission.   
						</p>
					
					<h4><b>Late Submission:</b></h4>
					
						<p>
							You are required to turn in all assignments, labs and projects, and no 
							makeup work will be given. If you have an emergency beyond your control 
							that prevents you from completing an assignment, you must notify the 
							instructor within 24 hours or normal late penalties will apply. 
							All homework, lab assignments and projects should be submitted by 
							the end of the day on the due date. Assignments received after 11:59 PM EDT 
							on the due date are considered late. The late penalty is 10% off each day.   
							Work which is more than five days late will receive a zero. 
							If you have an emergency beyond your control that prevents 
							you from completing an assignment, lab or project you must notify 
							the instructor before the submission due date or normal late penalties will apply.
						</p>
					
					<h4><b>Cell Phone Usage:</b></h4>
					
						<p>
							There will be absolutely no cell phone usage in class. 
							All cell phones and pagers must be turned off or silenced before 
							entering any classroom, lab, or formal academic or performance event.
						</p>
					
					<h4><b>End-of-Semester Evaluation:</b></h4>
					
						<p>
							In an ongoing effort to improve the quality of instruction, you are asked to complete a 
							web-based course and instructor evaluation, to be administered during the last 
							week of class. Students failing to submit the evaluation, will be assigned the grade of <b>“Incomplete.”</b>
						</p>
					
					<h4><b>FERPA Disclaimer for Assessment:</b></h4>
					
						<p>
							The College of Liberal Arts is keenly interested in assuring the quality and 
							integrity of its General Education Program. Every semester, randomly-selected students 
							from each General Education course will be required to submit samples of their work to 
							an independent and objective assessment by faculty. No personally identifiable information 
							about any student will be used for the purposes of this assessment, 
							and assessment results will have no bearing whatsoever on student grades.
						</p>
				
				<h1>DISABILITY POLICY STATEMENT:</h1>
				
					<p>
						Students in need of accommodation due to a disability should contact the Access and Accommodation Office 
						to complete the verification process to become approved for services. In order to receive accommodations, 
						each term, students will request accommodation and faculty notification forms through the Access Office 
						online system

							Please note the following additional information from the Access and Accommodation Office (AAO):
						</u>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (504) and the Americans with 
						Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2009 (ADAAA), “otherwise qualified” students with disabilities 
						are protected from discrimination and may be entitled to “reasonable accommodations” intended to 
						ensure equal access to all courses, programs, and services without a change of curriculum. Examples 
						of accommodations include but are not limited to: testing accommodations, providing alternative 
						format textbooks and tests, note-taking support, and modifications of policies or procedures. Equal 
						Access may require moving a class or event to a physically accessible room, making websites accessible 
						to screen readers, providing sign language interpreters, and captioning videos. All students requesting 
						to be recognized as a student with a disability or requiring accommodations must first self-identify by 
						requesting accommodations with the designated Access Coordinator for their campus or program and complete 
						the verification process.

				<h1>HONOR CODE:</h1>
				
					<h2>
						Students are expected to follow the College of Liberal Arts Honor code.
					</h2>
					
						<ul style="padding-left:20px">
							<li>
								You may ask for help on assignments from other students, 
								as long as the purpose is to help you understand, not for 
								the helper to do your work for you.
							</li>
							<li>
								You may not use copies of material created by other students, 
								or obtained from other sources such as the Internet, even if 
								you plan to modify the material.
							</li>
							<li>
								You should not give copies of your material to other students in any form.
							</li>
							<li>
								Do not copy or use material from other sources unless explicitly directed by 
								the instructor.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p> 
							Any form of cheating on an assignment, homework, lab, exam, or test will result in a zero score for the 
							assignment and a possible referral to the Honor Committee. If you are confused as to the difference
							between helping each other (which is encouraged) and cheating (which will not be tolerated), ask your instructor.
						</p>

						<p> 
							If you assist someone else in cheating, you can also be charged with cheating yourself. This can include 
							giving another student access to your computer account, negligently permitting another student to access 
							your account, or posting answer keys where others can access them. Protect your account as if your academic
